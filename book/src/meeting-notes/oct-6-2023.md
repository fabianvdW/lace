# Core Team Meeting Notes

## Abstract Syntax Trees
* AST needs parentheses
* Before typechecking: name resolution with stack-graphs
* One AST per file
* One DST per file

## Name resolution
* attempt order:
  * StackGraphs (we will do this!):
    * name res per file as well (parallel)
  * Async:
    * Generate async tasks per declaration/resolution/etc
    * sort according to heuristic
    * run in FuturesUnordered
* Everything but use statements can be per-item

## Spans
* Work with IDs per AST node
* Vec of spans referred to by the IDs
  * Per parser so per file
* need to be forwarded all the way to MIR

## Type Checking
* errors during type checking all need to be collected
* Typechecking must continue even when unifies fail
* 

## Macros/Metaprogramming/Comptime
* part of the language, after/during typechecking:
  * can define new modules etc, interact with name res
  * become decorators
  * functions can take syntax as parameters - compile time reflection
